# 1.6.0
Release Date: 18 July 2013

This is a combined release of the Akvo FLOW Dashboard and Field Survey app whose major feature is survey translations. Survey translations allow users to enter multiple translations for a single FLOW survey so that data collectors in the field can conduct a survey in their local language.

Weâ€™ve made 181 languages available in the language list, but any language with a non-Roman alphabet or any language that reads anything other than left-to-right is experimental at this point.

In order to take advantage of the survey translations feature, users must be running both the 1.6.0 Dashboard or higher and the 1.11.0 Field Survey app or higher.

* Enhance map placemark detail pane to display survey questions in alphabetical order (#291)
* Add version to footer to show user what version the Dashboard is running (#294)

## Deployments and infrastructure
* Upgrade included jar files for Dashboard to GAE SDK 1.8.1 (#274)

## Bug fixes and misc
* Resolve emberjs deprecation warnings on flowaglimmerofhope dashboard (#225)

* Fix a bug where the surveyInstance Count was creating new entities each time instead of checking first whether there was a matching one already existing (#235)
* Fix a bug where spreadsheet import was using different summarization customs than the device, resulting in confusion in the backend for OTHER types (#250)

Improvements in Data tab and Inspect Data table
* Fixing filtering in Inspect Data table - Fix a bug in filtering for Device ID and Submitter in Inspect Data table (#212)
* Fix a paging bug in Inspect Data table where cursor reset to zero (#251)

Improvements to Bulk Upload tool usability

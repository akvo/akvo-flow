# 1.6.0
Release Date: 18 July 2013

This is a combined release of the Akvo FLOW Dashboard and Field Survey app whose major feature is survey translations. Survey translations allow users to enter multiple translations for a single FLOW survey so that data collectors in the field can conduct a survey in their local language.

We’ve made 181 languages available in the language list, but any language with a non-Roman alphabet or any language that reads anything other than left-to-right is experimental at this point.

In order to take advantage of the survey translations feature, users must be running both the 1.6.0 Dashboard or higher and the 1.11.0 Field Survey app or higher.

## Survey translations
* Implement survey translations for FLOW Dashboard (#177)

## Interface and usability improvements
* Temporarily hide unused items on Dashboard (#253)
* Revert to creating short survey IDs to adapt to GAE datastore change that started creating very long IDs (#254)
* Fix a bug where Edit data window wasn't loading questions correctly while navigating between records from different surveys (#281)
* Fix a bug where survey groups weren't sorting alphabetically in dropdowns in Devices, Data and Reports tabs (#286)
* Enhance map placemark detail pane to show all available photos for a survey taken at that point (#289)
* Enhance map placemark detail pane to display survey questions in alphabetical order (#291)
* Add version to footer to show user what version the Dashboard is running (#294)

## Deployments and infrastructure
* Upgrade included jar files for Dashboard to GAE SDK 1.8.1 (#274)

## Bug fixes and misc
* Resolve emberjs deprecation warnings on flowaglimmerofhope dashboard (#225)

* Fix a bug where spreadsheet import was using different summarization customs than the device, resulting in confusion in the backend for OTHER types (#250)

Improvements in Data tab and Inspect Data table

/**
 * Ported java version of python geocell: http://code.google.com/p/geomodel/source/browse/trunk/geo/geocell.py
 *
 * Defines the notion of 'geocells' and exposes methods to operate on them.

    A geocell is a hexadecimal string that defines a two dimensional rectangular
    region inside the [-90,90] x [-180,180] latitude/longitude space. A geocell's
    'resolution' is its length. For most practical purposes, at high resolutions,
    geocells can be treated as single points.

    Much like geohashes (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geohash), geocells are
    hierarchical, in that any prefix of a geocell is considered its ancestor, with
    geocell[:-1] being geocell's immediate parent cell.

    To calculate the rectangle of a given geocell string, first divide the
    [-90,90] x [-180,180] latitude/longitude space evenly into a 4x4 grid like so:

                 +---+---+---+---+ (90, 180)
                 | a | b | e | f |
                 +---+---+---+---+
                 | 8 | 9 | c | d |
                 +---+---+---+---+
                 | 2 | 3 | 6 | 7 |
                 +---+---+---+---+
                 | 0 | 1 | 4 | 5 |
      (-90,-180) +---+---+---+---+

    NOTE: The point (0, 0) is at the intersection of grid cells 3, 6, 9 and c. And,
          for example, cell 7 should be the sub-rectangle from
          (-45, 90) to (0, 180).

    Calculate the sub-rectangle for the first character of the geocell string and
    re-divide this sub-rectangle into another 4x4 grid. For example, if the geocell
    string is '78a', we will re-divide the sub-rectangle like so:

                   .                   .
                   .                   .
               . . +----+----+----+----+ (0, 180)
                   | 7a | 7b | 7e | 7f |
                   +----+----+----+----+
                   | 78 | 79 | 7c | 7d |
                   +----+----+----+----+
                   | 72 | 73 | 76 | 77 |
                   +----+----+----+----+
                   | 70 | 71 | 74 | 75 |
      . . (-45,90) +----+----+----+----+
                   .                   .
                   .                   .

    Continue to re-divide into sub-rectangles and 4x4 grids until the entire
    geocell string has been exhausted. The final sub-rectangle is the rectangular
    region for the geocell.

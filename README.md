[Akvo Flow](http://akvo.org/products/akvoflow/) is a tool for collecting, evaluating and displaying of geographically referenced data. It is composed of an [android mobile app](https://github.com/akvo/akvo-flow-mobile/) and an online web-based platform. This repository contains code for the web-based platform that comprises a [backend engine](https://github.com/akvo/akvo-flow/tree/master/GAE) and a [dashboard user interface](https://github.com/akvo/akvo-flow/tree/master/Dashboard).  Alongside the dashboard and mobile apps, is a [data import and export component](https://github.com/akvo/akvo-flow-services).

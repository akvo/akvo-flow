[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/akvo/akvo-flow.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/akvo/akvo-flow)

[Akvo Flow](http://akvo.org/products/akvoflow/) is a tool for collecting, evaluating and displaying of geographically referenced data. It is composed of an [android mobile app](https://github.com/akvo/akvo-flow-mobile/) and an online web-based platform. This repository contains code for the web-based platform that comprises a [backend engine](https://github.com/akvo/akvo-flow/tree/master/GAE) and a [dashboard user interface](https://github.com/akvo/akvo-flow/tree/master/Dashboard).  Alongside the dashboard and mobile apps, is a [data import and export component](https://github.com/akvo/akvo-flow-services).

You can read more about the [motivation and history of Akvo Flow](http://www.akvo.org/blog/?p=4836) as well as its place in [the platform of tools created by Akvo](http://www.akvo.org/blog/?p=4822).

## Development

### Start

To run Flow:

    docker-compose up --build -d && docker-compose logs -f

Flow should be running [here](http://localhost:8888) and you can login with user "akvo.flow.user.test@gmail.com"

You also have the appengine admin console [here](http://localhost:8888/_ah/admin)

The Docker-Compose environment will have:

1. A fake s3 server.
2. A fake flow services, that always returns 200.
3. The dev environment.

It downloads a prepopulated database from https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/akvoflow/test-data/local_db.bin *if* there is none.

It will use the [dev appengine-web.xml](tests/dev-appengine-web.xml) *if* there is none.

See the [devserver.sh](ci/devserver.sh) for more details.

### UI development

Once Flow is started, any changes in the Dashboard folder will trigger a build of the UI code, except for the ClojureScript bit.

If you are going to work on the ClojureScript side, you can run a watch process with:

    docker-compose exec -u akvo akvo-flow /bin/bash -c "cd Dashboard/app/cljs && lein watch"

Or run the commands from a terminal inside the container:

    docker-compose exec -u akvo akvo-flow /bin/bash
    cd Dashboard/app/cljs
    lein watch

### Backend development

The appengine dev server is started in debug mode, listening in port 5005.

It is expected that your IDE understand the Maven pom and that it compiles the Java classes to the right place.

After you IDE compiles the classes, the dev server should refresh the webcontext. Due to some Mac performance issues with Docker, the refresh interval is 20 secs instead of the default 5 secs. You can change the scan interval in GAE/pom.xml. You can also trigger a reload hitting [the reload url](http://localhost:8888/_ah/reloadwebapp).

If you need to restart the server:

    docker-compose exec -u akvo -d akvo-flow /bin/bash -c "cd GAE && mvn appengine:stop appengine:run >> ./target/build.log"

Remember that you also can run those commands from a terminal inside the container.

### Stop

    docker-compose stop

### Tear down and reset

    docker-compose down
    rm -rf GAE/target

### Test instances and Manual deployments

If you want to use a configuration different from the dev one, checkout the akvo-flow-server-config directory into `..` and run:

    switch_tenant.sh akvoflowsandbox

To switch back to the dev setup:

    swith_to_local_tenant.sh

To deploy the current state of the docker container to whatever tenant you last switched to, run:


    docker-compose exec -u akvo akvo-flow ./dev-deploy.sh
